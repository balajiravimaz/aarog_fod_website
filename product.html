                        shell
                        is comparatively hard and protective than other packaging materials.
                        Coconut shells are also a biodegradable alternative to hard plastics; these shells are several

                        idea is to provide them a product with authentic look as well as with biodegradable form.</li>
                    <li> <span class="green">&check;</span> Coconut Tree has been called as <b>Tree of Life</b> since

                        along with the added advantage of <b>high lignin content.</b> So it is resistance to various
                        stresses.
                    </li>
                    <li> <span class="green">&check;</span> The shell also <b>absorbs less moisture</b> due to its
                        <b>low
                            cellulose content.</b> So it won’t absorb

                    wrap inside the
                    shell as an inner layer and fill the grated coconut with specific quantity.</p>
                <p class="justify">Cover the top of the shell with same food graded shrink wrap by providing some space
                    inside the shell
                    and the pack will be more protective. Eventually we will stick the label over the shell.</p>
                <p class="justify">After the product is developed with protective packaging, we should store the grated
                    fresh coconut with
                    cold storage to maintain its flavour, colour and to increase its shelf life</p>
